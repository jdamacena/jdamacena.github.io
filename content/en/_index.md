Hi, I’m Junior Damacena,

A passionate Android and Web Developer from Brazil dedicated to building innovative apps and web experiences that solve real-world problems. With hands-on experience in Android and Flutter, I love transforming creative ideas into polished, user-friendly products.

Beyond mobile, I also work with web development with Node.js, Vue and React (NextJS) having developed projects involving both front and backend with deploy to the cloud using CI/CD pipelines!

My portfolio includes making personal productivity tools like a URL shortener that looks amazing, a fun website that lets you draw and records the drawing to play it back, save or share, and many others (links below!).

 I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, sharing open-source projects, and continuously learning new things, not only to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape but also to satisfy my insatiable curiosity.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing 2D platformers on emulators - or trying my hand at making them, exploring the latest sci-fi movies and series, or thinking about my next DIY projects.

**Fun fact**: I DIYed my own table with a welder and an angle grinder.

**Skills:** 

Some of my skills are
- Android Development
- Flutter Development
- Web Development (APIs, frontend)
- UI/UX Principles
- API Integration
- Learn Quickly
- Speaking English, Portuguese and French
- I can turn a PVC pipe into a flute

**Featured Projects:**
- URL Shortener [(Live Here)](https://mytinylink.netlify.app): A configurable, brandable URL shortener built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and MongoDB.
- Drawing Video [(Live Here)](https://jdamacena.github.io/DrawingVideo/): A web-based whiteboard recorder for creating and sharing drawings.
- Movies Fan [(github)](https://github.com/jdamacena/fa_de_filme): This Flutter app helps me discover what's new in the movies world.
