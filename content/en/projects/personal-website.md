## Static Websites vs Regular Websites

Static websites are sites that only use HTML, CSS and Javascript, they don't have a server on the backend modifying and tailoring what each user sees, hence the name. That is in direct contrast to dinamic websites, like YouTube or Google, these sites need to constantly be talking to a server to do things like access a database or do some logic.

Due to the fact that dinamic websites need to do more stuff before delivering the site to the client, they tend to be slower to load and usually are heavier since they are usually more complex. Static websites on the other hand are blazing fast since they are created using the simplest tech on the web - HTML, CSS and Javascript - and they don't do any processing before delivering the site to the client, saving resources and time. And they are usualy simpler since more complex websites tend to need a server and therefore can't be static.

Static sites have a big advantage that is, they're very cheap and even free to host. Since they use very little resources and don't need processing on the server, they can be hosted very easily.

## Why HUGO?

HUGO is one of many static sites generator, so why did I chose it? HUGO has many advantages over other static websites generators, here are the highlights:

- **HUGO is free and Open-source**, what means you don't have to spend any money to on this powerful tool, and being open-source you can personally reveal it's code, and if there is a bug you don't have to wait for an update, you can fix it yourself.
- **There are hundreds of free themes available for download**, and it is very easy to install, modify and update themes, in this site I used the [Terminal Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-terminal/), from Panr.
- **The building process is very fast**, so during development you can reveal all your chances on the actual website basicly instantly.
- **HUGO have a great community around it**, if you need help with anything, it's very easy to find help.
