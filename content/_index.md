Hi, I’m Junior Damacena!

I’m a passionate Android and Mobile Developer from Brazil, dedicated to building innovative apps and web experiences that solve real-world problems. With hands-on experience in Android (Kotlin, Java) and cross-platform frameworks like Flutter, I love transforming creative ideas into polished, user-friendly products. My portfolio includes everything from personal productivity tools to fun web apps and even projects that showcase NASA’s Mars rover photos!

Beyond mobile, I’m also skilled in web development (Node.js, Vue.js, HTML/JS/CSS) and have a keen eye for clean UI/UX design. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, sharing open-source projects, and continuously learning to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech landscape.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me gaming, exploring the latest sci-fi movies, or brainstorming my next side project.

**Skills:**
- Android Development (Kotlin, Java)
- Flutter & Dart
- Web Development (Node.js, Vue.js, HTML/JS/CSS)
- UI/UX Principles & Mobile App Design
