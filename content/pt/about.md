## Who Am I

My name is Junior Damacena. I’m a Computer Scientist and Android/Mobile Developer from Brazil. I love everything programming; in the past, I have worked with native Android Development with Kotlin and Java and the Xamarin Framework (C#) as well as some Web Development. I also have used many languages and technologies in various personal projects, tech such as Flutter, Node.JS, Python and Arduino.
